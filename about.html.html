    <h2>Fansies Story</h2>
    <p>Fancies were established in 2025 by a small group of students in Limpopo. Their main goal is to make phone covers more vibrant and expressive, as most phones look the same these days. The design of our covers is taken from famous cartoons, anime and games.</p>
    <h2>Vision of Fansies</h2>
    <p>Our vision is to inspire our customers and other companies to let their inner child out occasionally.</p>
